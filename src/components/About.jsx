      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an AI Engineer currently pursuing my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Brandenburgische Technische Universität Cottbus. With a strong foundation in Computer Science from LUMS, I specialize in developing full-stack machine learning applications—from data curation and model training to deployment and monitoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience spans researching Explainable AI, optimizing legacy enterprise systems for 89% faster execution, and currently, building tooling for Large Language Model (LLM) experimentation at TU Berlin. I am passionate about using AI to solve real-world problems, demonstrated by my work developing adaptive learning tools for low-resourced education environments.
